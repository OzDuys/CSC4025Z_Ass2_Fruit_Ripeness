# About Dataset
This dataset includes images of tropical fruits at different ripeness stages. You'll find pictures of:

Fresh bananas, apples, and oranges

Rotten bananas, apples, and oranges

Unripe bananas, apples, and oranges

The goal is to help with training machine learning models that can identify whether a fruit is unripe, ripe, or rotten. It's useful for projects in fruit quality detection, food sorting systems, and smart agriculture.

All images are organized by category and can be used directly for classification tasks like training a CNN or MobileNet model. Perfect for anyone working on fruit freshness detection or related computer vision projec
